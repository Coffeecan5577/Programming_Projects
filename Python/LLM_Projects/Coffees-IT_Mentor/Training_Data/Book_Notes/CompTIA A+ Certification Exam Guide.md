#### Chapter 1: Safety and Professionalism

##### Talking Points of the Chapter
1. Learn how to present yourself with a proper appearance and professional manner
2. Talk to customers in a professional, productive manner
3. Discuss the tools of the trade and preparations necessary to deal with problems proactively
4. Use common safety procedures
5. Apply the best practice methodology to resolve problems

**Traits of a Tech**
1. Honesty/Integrity - Honesty means telling the truth, and integrity means doing the right thing, even when no one is looking
2. Dependability/Responsibility - A dependable person performs agreed-upon actions, and a responsible person is answerable for those actions.
3. Effective Communication - subsections listed below:
	1. Assertive Communication - Assertive communication is not pushy or bossy, but it is also not the language of a pushover. To do this, first show the other person that you understand and appreciate the importance of their feelings. Avoid using the word "you", because it can come across as accusatory. Make sure you understand the problem clearly without accusing the user directly. Next and lastly, tell the user what you need to prevent this error in the future.
	2. Respectful Communication - Follow the Ethic of Reciprocity, or the Golden Rule essentially. Make sure to follow the rules of civil conversation:
		1. *Actively Listen*
		2. *Avoid interrupting the customer as they describe the problem*
		3. *Just listen and take notes*
	3. Getting Answers - Make sure you are asking the right questions and also listening to the customers' answers. You can also repeat back the problem to the customer once they have finished speaking to ensure that you fully understand the issue.
	4. Expectations and Follow-Up:
		1. Timeline - Try to establish a clear timeline of repairs to the customer and do your best to always stay in communication with them about the repairs themselves.
		2. Options - Offer repair/replacement options as needed and let the customer decide on which route they want to take.
		3. Documentation - At the completion of your work, provide proper documentation of services performed.
4. Be Prepared! - This section will cover how to handle computing devices like a professional:
	1. Electrostatic Discharge:
		1. Antistatic tools - The key to avoiding ESD is to keep yourself and the computer you are working on grounded at the same level of potential electric energy. You can accomplish this by using an ESD strap that connects to the computer on one end, and to your bare wrist on the other end. You can also use antistatic mats that contain resistors to help ground the PC you are working on, along with antistatic bags (Make sure to store PC components inside the bag, and not on it.) **Exam Tip** - *Always disconnect power before repairing a computing device.*

**Troubleshooting Methodology**
An effective troubleshooting methodology includes:
	1. Talking to users to determine how and when the problem took place
	2. Determining a cause
	3. testing
	4. verification
	5. Documentation
CompTIA defines their own methodology in this chapter:
	1. *Identify the problem*
		1. Gather information from the user, identify user changes and if possible, perform backups before making changes
		2. Inquire regarding environmental/infrastructure changes
	2. *Establish a theory of probable cause*
		1. Conduct internal or external research based on symptoms
	3. *Test the theory to determine the cause*
		1. Once the theory is confirmed, determine next steps to resolve the problem
	4. *Establish a plan of action* to resolve the problem and implement a solution
		1. Refer to vendor documentation or instruction for guidance
	5. *Verify full system functionality* and if applicable, implement preventative measures
	6. *Document* findings, actions and outcomes
